# Improvements

- Removed the `config: true` value from the blacksmith.conf
  configuration file template.  We were already setting the
  `$BLACKSMITH_DEBUG` environment variable anyway...

# Software Updates

- `safe` has been updated to [v0.9.6][safe].

- `blacksmith` has been updated to [v0.4.0][blacksmith].
